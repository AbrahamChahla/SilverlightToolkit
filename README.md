# Silverlight Toolkit

Straight from Microsoft, the Silverlight Toolkit provides the developer community with new components, functionality, and an efficient way to help shape product development. Toolkit releases include open source code, samples & docs, plus design-time support for the Silverlight browser plugin.

# Silverlight 5 Toolkit

** This was the final release of the Silverlight Toolkit in December 2011 **

[Download on CodePlex](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/downloads/get/311823)

This is the 9th, newest, and final release of the toolkit targeting the Silverlight 5. New to this release are some controls targeting Silverlight 5's new 3D features. For more information on these 3D extensions, please check out [David Catuhe's blog entry](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eternalcoding/archive/2011/10/04/silverlight-toolkit-september-2011-for-silverlight-5-what-s-new.aspx) on the topic.

If you have previously installed the Silverlight 5 September 2011 toolkit, please make sure to uninstall before installing the December 2011 toolkit.

Note: _You must install XNA Studio in order to use the new Silverlight 3D templates. Otherwise the new templates will not show up._
